## 🚀 **Redesign SCRUMMY Fantasy Rugby Landing Page**

### 🎨 **Visual Style & Background**

- Implement a modern, dynamic gradient background transitioning from **Blazing Navy Blue** (`#003366`) at the top to **Electric Light Blue** (`#00A6FF`) at the bottom.
- Ensure a clean, striking, yet minimalistic visual feel.

### 🏉 **Enhanced 3D Rugby Ball Visual**

- Clearly position the floating 3D rugby ball subtly above and behind the main headline to create visual interest without obscuring text readability.
- Adjust ball color to a darker, richer shade for optimal contrast against headline text.
- Use gentle and natural floating animations to give a sophisticated 3D effect (consider subtle rotation or slow, vertical hover).

### ✨ **Dynamic Floating Elements**

- Replace current floating particles with elegant, gently drifting mini rugby balls or abstract geometric shapes (circles, triangles, dots).
- Animate them to slowly float upwards and fade in/out subtly to maintain visual interest without distraction.

### 🖋️ **Typography & Text Styling**

- Main headline text ("FANTASY RUGBY REIMAGINED"):
  - Font size significantly larger, bold, with letter spacing optimized for clarity.
  - Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) or vibrant **Striking Gold Yellow** (`#FFC700`) for maximum contrast.
- Subtext ("Build your ultimate rugby team... Launching soon!"):
  - Smaller font size, white, lighter font weight, neatly centered directly below the headline.
  - Increase line-height slightly for readability.

### ⏳ **Interactive Countdown Timer**

- Timer elements styled as rounded rectangular boxes with subtle shadows or depth.
- Numbers clearly visible in white or gold against a dark, semi-transparent background.
- Smooth number-transition animations (fade-in/out or flip animation).

### 📥 **Enhanced Call-to-Action (CTA)**

- Enlarge and center the email input field and "Join Waitlist" button.
- Round corners, subtle shadow for visual depth, and interactive hover effect (e.g., gentle upward movement, color intensity increase).
- Include placeholder text: "Enter your email" clearly readable.

### 🚨 **Urgency & Engagement Elements**

- Beneath the CTA, clearly display urgency-driven text: _"Spots are limited—reserve your early access now!"_ in slightly smaller, italicized font to reinforce scarcity.

### 📐 **Spacing and Layout**

- Ensure generous, balanced spacing between all sections (logo, headline, subtext, timer, CTA).
- Maintain visual balance and mobile responsiveness.

### 📱 **Mobile Optimization**

- Fully responsive, clean design—optimized for perfect readability and visual appeal on both mobile and desktop devices.

### 🎯 **Overall Goal**

Deliver a visually striking, engaging, modern landing page optimized for conversions, clearly communicating excitement and urgency for the upcoming SCRUMMY Fantasy Rugby app launch.
